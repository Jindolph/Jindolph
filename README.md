Hello!! world haha. actually, nice to meet you visitors.

My developer name is Jindolph. isn't it cool? thanks. i think you agree.

Now, I am studying how to create Web App with using different frameworks(ex.. Spring Boot and React.js)
Until middle of November, I've learned each of them.

For now, ... i want to learn how to use them in one, by creating(practicing) real projects.
I have some ideas for creative web apps, what i have needed is always techniques to embody those.

goodbye.
