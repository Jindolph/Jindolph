Nice to meet you visitors.   
   
My developer name is Jindolph.   
   
Now, I am studying how to create Web App with using different frameworks(ex.. Spring Boot and Next.js)   

For now, ... i want to learn how to use them in one, by creating(practicing) real projects.   
I have really good ideas for creative web apps, what i need is high skills to make them come true.   
   
goodbye.
